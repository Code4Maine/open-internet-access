A fabulous resource for community broadband networks.

[Maine fiber network for lease](http://www.fiercetelecom.com/press-releases/maines-1100-mile-three-ring-binder-high-speed-internet-network-complete)

An intresting article on where a town might possibly lease a line from. The Maine School and Library Network, I believe, leases lines from Time Warner and others and then provides it at low or no cost to schools and libraries.

[Salisbury, NC - a potential lead for how to do this](http://onthecommons.org/magazine/why-mighty-time-warner-so-scared-tiny-salisbury-north-carolina)

A fabulous article with many great quotes and takeaways, including a few towns and cities that could be potential leads:

  * "Would the private sector support a similar law prohibiting Wal Mart, for example, from lowering its price to reflect its lower borrowing costs compared to independent small retailers? To ask the question is to answer it."
  * Salisbury, NC -- email sent to city manager on 7/14/14 asking about people who might talk on setting up Fibrant, the town's local fiber optic network.
